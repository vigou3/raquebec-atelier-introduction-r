# 1.3 - Keeping the Canada information of the dataset.
airportsCanada <- airports[airports$country=='Canada',]

# 1.4 - Extraction of the genreral information about the distributions of the variables in the dataset and 
# understanding of the signification of those variables and the different modalities they can take.

# The relevance of the data.
# 1.5 - Correct the modalities of the variables and make a selection of those wo seem useful for the rest of the treatment.

# A similar reasoning is applicable for the country variable which will only have the modality Canada.
